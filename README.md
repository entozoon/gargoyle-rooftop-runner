Let's do this.

[Check it out!](https://entozoon.github.io/gargoyle-runner/)

Note: We need a leaderboard, that has to be a thing.

## Develop

		npm i
		npm start

## Deploy

		npm run deploy
		(push to master as normal)

## Future Ideas

* Free running mode - run left and right, as fast as you like after a crazy boost. Why not? I've built it with legit velocities..
